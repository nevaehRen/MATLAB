peaks searching

%% ===>> Step1: peaks searching parameters
%% ===>> Step2: show peaks searching result, first row using halfheight, second row using halfprominence, third row using
%% ===>> Step3: recording peak features
% --- Step3.1: adding peak(t3) and start(t1) and end(t5) of the local minimal 
% --- Step3.2: adding half increase(t2) and half decrease(t4), as well as 25% 50%
% --- Step3.3: adding half increase(t2) and half decrease(t4), as well as 25% 50%
% --- Step3.4: adding basal Ca activity
% --- Step3.5: adding period(defined by t2 time difference !)
% --- Step3.6: check, if has Name input, then save pics
